Bobby697: take a photo of the horizon
Bobby697: oh take a photo of that rock over there
Bobby697: why isn’t it taking more photos
OPPY4LIFE: Because it can’t send multiple photos a time
Bobby697: well why not, thats stupid
OPPY4LIFE : I don’t know, you try transmitting a photo 55 million km through space
OPPY4LIFE : It takes time for each message to be received on the other end and they have limited bandwidth
